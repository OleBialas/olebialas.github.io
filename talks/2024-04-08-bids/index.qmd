  An introduction to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) and the OpenNeuro platform.
abstract: In this talk, I give a brief introduction to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), which is an emerging standard for neuroimaging data. I argue that using BIDS and sharing data is valuable to the scientific community as well as the individual researcher. As an example, I show how an electroencephalography (EEG) dataset has to be formatted to conform to the BIDS standard.
