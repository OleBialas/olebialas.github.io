  A talk about the technical challenges neuroscientists face today.
abstract: |
  In this talk, presented at the German Museum Bonn, I describe how neuroscience has evolved from recording the responses of individual neurons to collecting massive datasets containing thousands of neurons. I outline the challenges but also the opportunities for insight that come with this development. Finally, I argue that we can tackle these challenges by taking established methods from computer science, like version control, and translating them to the scientific context.
