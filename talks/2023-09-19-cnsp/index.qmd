  A demo of the mTRFpy Python toolbox for modeling neural responses to continuous stimuli.
abstract: In this talk, presented at an online workshop of the Cognition and Natural Sensory Processing Initiative, I demonstrate the mTRFpy toolbox for estimating the Temporal Receptive Fields (TRFs) of neural responses to continuous stimuli (e.g. naturalstic speech). I first give an overview of the core functions of mTRFpy and then use simulated data to show how TRFs can recover neural responses from noisy data.
